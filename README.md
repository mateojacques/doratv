# DoraTV

Custom Twitch client I made in order to explore and discover various streams related to the same game or activity. 

Unfortunately, Twitch restricts a lot how the stream can be displayed on an external website, interrupting it every 10 minutes for 30 seconds, so if you are looking for a particular stream it's probably better to go to Twitch directly. 

Currently working on a multi stream view feature.

Tech stack: React, Material UI, Axios.
